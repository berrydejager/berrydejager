# Berry de Jager

Berry is a creative, sociable go-getter; one of the old-school types who's been taming computers since the 8-bit era. He loves designing and building projects that make (end-)users happy; these are mostly the truly good solutions; of course, based on Agile/DevOps/CICD/FOSS or otherwise.

It's a great quality that Berry can inspire people well and speaks everyone's language. Berry is an all-rounder and gets a lot of energy from sustainable innovation/breakthrough technologies.

During the day his passion is coding for [RawWorks.nl](https://www.rawworks.nl), at night he is an enthusiastic world improver with a focus on open-source and environmental friendly projects.
